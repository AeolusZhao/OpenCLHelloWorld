# OpenCLHelloWorld
New to OpenCL. This repository supposes to contain projects I created during the learning.

This projects here are all created under VS2017. Library references are hard linked to CUDA 10 default installation directory. These needs to be adjusted if being run on another PC.

I configured projects following this tutorial:

My PC is a XiaoMi Notebook Pro GTX running Windows 10. 

The example of VectorAddition and ImageRotation is from book Heterogeneous Computing with OpenCL 2.0. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-801414-1.00004-1. Copyright to Advanced Micro Devices. Inc. Published by elsevier Inc.
