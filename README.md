# OpenCLHelloWorld
New to OpenCL. This repository suppose to contain projects I created during the learning.

This project is created under VS2017. Library references are hard linked to my local directory. These needs to be adjusted if being run on another PC.
I configured this project following this tutorial:

My PC is a XiaoMi Notebook Pro GTX running Windows 10.
